### 🧩 Machine_Learning
1. Implemented **Simple and Multiple Linear Regression** models to analyze relationships between variables and predict continuous outcomes with precision.
2. Applied **Data Preprocessing and Automated Preprocessing** techniques, including data cleaning, encoding, scaling, and transformation, to prepare datasets for model training.
3. Performed **Feature Selection and Regularization (Lasso, Ridge)** to enhance model accuracy and prevent overfitting.
4. Built multiple **Regression and Classification Projects** using algorithms such as **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **KNN**, and **SVM** for predictive analysis.
5. Explored **Ensemble Methods** like Random Forest, Bagging, and Boosting to improve model robustness and accuracy.
6. Conducted **Algorithm Evaluation** using performance metrics such as R², MAE, MSE, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
7. Executed **Clustering Techniques** (K-Means, Hierarchical) to uncover hidden patterns and segment datasets effectively.
8. Performed **Hypothesis Testing** to validate statistical assumptions and derive meaningful data insights.
9. Developed **Time Series Analysis** models for forecasting and trend analysis using ARIMA and other techniques.
10. Delivered multiple **end-to-end projects** demonstrating complete data science workflow — from data collection and cleaning to model deployment and insight generation.
